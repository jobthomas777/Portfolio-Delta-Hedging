# Static vs Dynamic Hedging (Futures)

## Overview
This project compares **static vs dynamic futures hedging** for a commodity portfolio.  
It highlights how dynamic rebalancing can better manage risk compared to a one-time static hedge.

## Key Features
- **Static Hedge** → one-time hedge set at day 0, never adjusted
- **Dynamic Hedge** → futures position gradually rebalanced toward target hedge ratio
- Transaction costs included for realism
- Side-by-side visualization of portfolio performance under both strategies
